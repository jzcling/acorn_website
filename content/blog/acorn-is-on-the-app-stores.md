## I'd love to hear your feedback

After about 6 months of hard work at creating the app, Acorn is finally on the app stores and ready for download. It’s been a steep learning curve having picked up mobile development from scratch and I hope what I’ve done here can be useful to you on a regular basis.

Acorn is your one-stop shop for the latest deals and happenings in Singapore, compiled by aggregating all your favourite Singapore blogs. Check out the latest deals, news, events and life hacks in a nutshell!

I’m still trying to make the app as relevant for users as possible so please bear with me if there are any bugs you may find. I would love to hear any feedback you may have and you can contact me at jlzc89@gmail.com.
